# Star-Type-Classification-using-ML-Models

Classifying stars into **Giants** and **Dwarfs** using popular Machine Learning algorithms.

## Overview

Projects are a great way to strengthen the understanding of any concept. In this project, we explore the power of machine learning by applying it to a **real-world astronomical task** â€” classifying stars based on their physical properties.

Astronomical telescopes generate a massive amount of data, and manually analyzing this information is both time-consuming and inefficient. Machine Learning (ML) offers a scalable and efficient approach to process and classify such data, helping astronomers in identifying different types of stars.

This project demonstrates how various ML models can be used to classify stars as **Dwarfs (0)** or **Giants (1)** based on features like magnitude, temperature, color index, and more.

## Algorithms Used

We experimented with the following machine learning models:

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Random Forest**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
- Jupyter/Google Colab
